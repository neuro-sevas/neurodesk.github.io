[{"body":"The goal of neurodesk is to provide users with a large choice of tools to use in their pipelines. Use the guide below to add a tool to neurodesktop or neurocontainers.\nGuiding principles To decide if a tool should be packaged in a singularity container in neurocontainers or be installed in the neurodesktop container we are currently following these guiding principles:\n neurodesk is not a package manager. This means we are not distributing tools in containers that can easily be installed via a standard package manager neurodesk allows users to have multiple versions of tools in parallel via lmod, this means that if different versions of a tool can’t be installed in parallel we package the tool inside a container. neurodesk aims to provide tooling to link tools from different containers (such as workflow managers like nipype or nextflow). This means that if a tool is required to coordinate various container-tools, it should be in the neurodesktop container.  Examples:\n    easy install coordinates containers small in size latest version is ok useful to most users Conclusion     git yes yes yes yes yes neurodesktop   lmod no yes yes yes yes neurodesktop   nipype yes yes yes yes yes neurodesktop   vscode yes yes yes yes yes neurodesktop   itksnap yes no yes yes yes container?   convert3D yes no yes no no container   fsl no no no no no container   mrtrix no no no no no container   freesurfer no no no no no container    Adding new recipes Refer to neurodocker for more information on neurodocker recipes\nBuild container To build a container, set up environment with:\n Docker, the version in our CI environment Python, the version in our CI environment  And then follow these steps:\n Sync/modify Neurodocker, the dependency we are using to build containers:  Press “Fetch upstream” in https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurodocker to check if our fork of Neurodocker is already up-to-date If there are upstream commits that are not synced yet, open an issue in https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers/issues, requesting one of Neurodesk admins to pull-in latest changes from Neurodocker upstream into our fork of Neurodocker If relevant to your project, add recipe to neurodocker (https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurodocker) and create a pull request to neurodocker (add new tool in a branch!)   Clone the neurocontainers repository: Optional: Fork neurocontainers and setup github actions\n Fork https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers into your account. Go to your neurocontainers fork. If Actions tab is missing, go to Settings \u003e Actions. Select Allow all actions. Then Save. In the actions tab, select “I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them”  Pushes to the recipes in your fork will now trigger actions to build the respective docker container, and push them to your Github Packages.\n   https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers\ngit clone https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers/ Copy the directory template and rename to newapp in neurocontainers/recipes  cd neurocontainers/recipes cp -R template newapp Modify build.sh in neurocontainers/recipes/newapp to build your application and update README.md (make sure the version is correct in the README!)  cd newapp (edit build.sh as required) (edit README.md as required) Upload your application to object storage first if needed, so you can then download it in build.sh (ask for instructions about this if you don’t know the key, and never share it anywhere public!)\nRun update-builders.sh - This will auto-create the CI workflow for the application (or manually duplicate the template file and rename all occurances of template to newapp)  cd ../.. sh update-builders.sh  if the CI build runs out of space, add the application to the following txt to add additional space. https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers/blob/master/.github/workflows/free-up-space-list.txt. Note this, significantly increases CI run time, only use in cases of space errors.\n  Build and test the container locally\n clone our fork of Neurodocker: git clone https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurodocker/ install neurodocker: cd neurodocker; python -m pip install . run the build script with the –debug flag: https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers/blob/master/recipes/lcmodel/build.sh  chmod +x build.sh ./build.sh -debug test running some commands within the container that should be available in your local docker container repository if your application requires a Matlab Runtime and you get an error about shared library “libmwlaunchermain.so” not found, check which version of the runtime was installed by the build script    Update changes in local git repository\n  git add recipes/newapp/build.sh recipes/newapp/README.md .github/workflows/newapp.yml git config user.email \"the email that you use for github\" git config user.name \"your name\" git commit Generate git personal access token (if you don’t have one already)  Browse to https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers/ Press on your picture in upper right corner --\u003e Setting --\u003e Developer Settings --\u003e Personal Access Token Press on “generate personal access token” Write something in “Notes” (doesn’t matter what, it’s for your own use) Check “repo” Check “Workflow” Press “Generate Token” at the bottom Copy the token displayed on the screen into a file, so you’ll have it later Test the container locally, and if successful push repo to trigger the automatic build on GitHub  git pull git push  Go to neurocontainers/actions. Check that the most recent workflow run in the list terminated successfully (green). Otherwise, click on it, click on “build docker”, and the line that caused the error will be highlighted\n  Find your new package under https://github.com/orgs/NeuroDesk/packages?repo_name=neurocontainers\nEnter the name of the package in the search box, and verify that the full package name shows up in the format toolName_toolVersion\n  Obtain buildDate by clicking on the full package name that came up in the search. The build date will be the newest date shown under Recent tagged image versions\n  Use toolName, toolVersion and buildDate from the previous two steps to manually download the package by typing the following in a terminal open in Neurodesktop\n  bash /neurocommand/local/fetch_and_run.sh toolName toolVersion buildDate ml toolName/toolVersion For example: If the full package name that comes up in the step 11 is itksnap_3.8.0, and the newest date under Recent tagged image versions is 20210322\nThe command to use in a terminal open in Neurodesktop is:\nbash /neurocommand/local/fetch_and_run.sh itksnap 3.8.0 20210322 ml toolName/toolVersion Depreciation notice For VNM users use:\nbash /neurodesk/local/fetch_and_run.sh toolName toolVersion buildDate ml toolName/toolVersion   Test the new container. Run some commands, to see all is good\n  Fork https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocommand/ to your Github account\n  Edit an entry for your package in your fork of neurocommand/blob/main/neurodesk/apps.json based on one of the other entries (generating one menu item for opening a terminal inside the containers, and one menu item for the GUI, if relevant). Notice that in the json file, the version field should contain the buildDate\n  Include an icon file in your fork of neurocommand/tree/main/neurodesk/icons\n  Send a pull request from your fork of neurocommand to https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocommand/\n  When the pull request is merged by Neurodesk admins, it will trigger an action to build the singularity container, distribute it in all object storage locations and on CVMFS, and it will update the menus in the desktop image on the next daily build\n  Check in the dev build if everything is ok before releasing a new version of Neurodesktop:\n  sudo docker pull vnmd/neurodesktop-dev:latest \u0026\u0026 sudo docker run --shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --name neurodesktop -v ~/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage -e HOST_UID=\"$(id -u)\" -e HOST_GID=\"$(id -g)\" -p 8080:8080 -h neurodesktop-dev vnmd/neurodesktop-dev:latest Consider contributing a tutorial about the new tool: https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurodesk.github.io/tree/hugo-docsy/content/en/tutorials  ","categories":"","description":"Add a tool to neurodesktop\n","excerpt":"Add a tool to neurodesktop\n","ref":"/developers/new_tools/add_tool/","tags":"","title":"Add tools"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"The architecture of the Neurodesk ecosystem\n","excerpt":"The architecture of the Neurodesk ecosystem\n","ref":"/developers/architecture/","tags":"","title":"Architecture"},{"body":"Overview For an overview of the Neurodesk platform, go to: Overview\nQuick Start To install the Neurodesktop container, go to: Getting Started\nFeedback \u0026 Inquiries To ask questions or suggest new features, join the discussion on github.

To do so, create the file menus/submenus/vnm-[[tool-name]].directory and add the following information inside:\n[Desktop Entry] Name=[[Tool Name]] Comment=[[Tool Name]] Icon=/home/neuro/.config/lxpanel/LXDE/icons/[[icon-name]].png Type=Directory If a specific icon is available in the menus/icons directory, replace [[icon-name]] by its name. Otherwise, use vnm.\nCreate the application Finally, we have to create the actual application by creating the file menus/applications/vnm-[[tool-name]]-[[0.0.0]].desktop. The name of this file must contain the version of the tool (once again to allow multiple versions to live inside the same directory). Add the following description to this file:\n[Desktop Entry] Name=[[Tool Name]] [[0.0.0]] [[(Install only)]] GenericName=[[Tool Name]] [[0.0.0]] Comment=The description of what clicking on this application does. # This will be the tooltip of the application. Exec=The command used to run the application. Icon=/home/neuro/.config/lxpanel/LXDE/icons/[[icon-name]].png Type=Application Categories=[[Tool-name]] Terminal=true # or false The important part here is the value of Exec. If the tool is in the form of a singularity image, you should run the following command:\nbash /usr/share/fetch_and_run.sh [[tool-name]] [[0.0.0]] [[YYYYMMDD]] [[cmd]] [[args]] What fetch_and_run.sh does is check if the image is already installed as a module. If not, it checks whether it can be installed or not (return 1 if not possible). After that, it installs the image as a module. If [[cmd]] is specified, once the image is installed, it runs the command by giving the arguments from [[args]]. Here are two examples for FreeSurfer and FreeView. This first one only installs the image as a module:\nbash /usr/share/fetch_and_run.sh freesurfer 6.0.1 20200506 And this does the same but runs FreeView afterward:\nbash /usr/share/fetch_and_run.sh freesurfer 6.0.1 20200506 freeview The resulting .desktop file corresponding to FreeView contains:\n[Desktop Entry] Name=FreeView 6.0.1 GenericName=FreeView 6.0.1 Comment=Start FreeView 6.0.1 Exec=bash /usr/share/fetch_and_run.sh freesurfer 6.0.1 20200506 freeview Icon=/home/neuro/.config/lxpanel/LXDE/icons/run.png Type=Application Categories=FreeSurfer Terminal=true ","categories":"","description":"Menu entries in neurodesktop\n","excerpt":"Menu entries in neurodesktop\n","ref":"/developers/new_tools/menu_entries/","tags":"","title":"Menu entries"},{"body":"Getting started Open Visual Studio Code:\nOpen the folder: “/home/user/Desktop/neurodesktop-storage” or a subfolder in which you would like to store this demo.

The participant is viewing a frequency tagged display and is cued to attend to dots tagged at one frequency or another (6 Hz, 7.5 Hz) for long, 15 s trials. To read more about the dataset, click here\nPlotting settings To make sure our plots retain their interactivity, set the following line at the top of your notebook:\n%matplotlib qt This will mean your figures pop out as individual, interactive plots that will allow you to explore the data, rather than as static, inline plots. You can switch “qt” to “inline” to switch back to default, inline plotting.\nLoading and processing data  NOTE: MNE has many helpful tutorials which delve into data processing and analysis using MNE-python in much further detail. These can be found here\n Begin by importing the necessary modules and creating a pointer to the data:\n# Interactive plotting %matplotlib qt # Import modules import os import numpy as np import mne # Load data sample_data_folder = '/home/user/Desktop/neurodesktop-storage/EEGDemo/Data_sample' sample_data_raw_file = os.path.join(sample_data_folder, 'sub-01', 'eeg', 'sub-01_task-FeatAttnDec_eeg.vhdr') raw = mne.io.read_raw_brainvision(sample_data_raw_file , preload=True) the raw.info structure contains information about the dataset:\n# Display data info print(raw) print(raw.info) This data file did not include a montage. Lets create one using standard values for the electrodes we have:\n# Create montage montage = {'Iz': [0, -110, -40], 'Oz': [0, -105, -15], 'POz': [0, -100, 15], 'O1': [-40, -106, -15], 'O2': [40, -106, -15], } montageuse = mne.channels.make_dig_montage(ch_pos=montage, lpa=[-82.5, -19.2, -46], nasion=[0, 83.2, -38.3], rpa=[82.2, -19.2, -46]) # based on mne help file on setting 10-20 montage Next, lets visualise the data.\nraw.plot() This should open an interactive window in which you can scroll through the data. See the MNE documentation for help on how to customise this plot.\nIf, upon visual inspection, you decide to exclude one of the channels, you can specify this in raw.info[‘bads’] now. For example:\nraw.info['bads'] = ['POz'] Next, we’ll extract our events. The trigger channel in this file is incorrectly scaled, so we’ll correct that before we extract our events:\n# Correct trigger scaling trigchan = raw.pick('TRIG').copy() trigchan._data = trigchan._data*1000000 # Extract events events = mne.find_events(trigchan, stim_channel='TRIG', consecutive=True, initial_event=True, verbose=True) print('Found %s events, first five:' % len(events)) print(events[:5]) # Plot events mne.viz.plot_events(events, raw.info['sfreq'], raw.first_samp) Now that we’ve extracted our events, we can extract our EEG channels and do some simple pre-processing:\n# select eeg_data = raw.copy().pick_types(eeg=True, exclude=['TRIG']) # Set montage eeg_data.info.set_montage(montageuse) # Interpolate eeg_data_interp = eeg_data.copy().interpolate_bads(reset_bads=True) # Filter Data eeg_data_interp.filter(l_freq=1, h_freq=45, h_trans_bandwidth=0.1) Let’s visualise our data again now that it’s cleaner:\n#plot results again, this time with some events and scaling. eeg_data_interp.plot(events=events, duration=10.0, scalings=dict(eeg=0.00005), color='k', event_color='r') That’s looking good! We can even see hints of the frequency tagging. It’s about time to epoch our data.\n# Epoch to events of interest event_id = {'attend 6Hz K': 23, 'attend 7.5Hz K': 27} # Extract 15 s epochs relative to events, baseline correct, linear detrend, and reject # epochs where eeg amplitude is \u003e 400 epochs = mne.Epochs(eeg_data_interp, events, event_id=event_id, tmin=0, tmax=15, baseline=(0, 0), reject=dict(eeg=0.000400), detrend=1) # Drop bad trials epochs.drop_bad() We can average these epochs to form Event Related Potentials (ERPs):\n# Average erpochs to form ERPs attend6 = epochs['attend 6Hz K'].average() attend75 = epochs['attend 7.5Hz K'].average() # Plot ERPs evokeds = dict(attend6=list(epochs['attend 6Hz K'].iter_evoked()), attend75=list(epochs['attend 7.5Hz K'].iter_evoked())) mne.viz.plot_compare_evokeds(evokeds, combine='mean') In this plot, we can see that the data are frequency tagged. While these data were collected, the participant was performing an attention task in which two visual stimuli were flickering at 6 Hz and 7.5 Hz respectively. On each trial the participant was cued to monitor one of these two stimuli for brief bursts of motion. From previous research, we expect that the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) should be larger at the attended frequency than the unattended frequency. Lets check if this is true.\nWe’ll begin by exporting our epoched EEG data to a numpy array\n# Preallocate n_samples = attend6.data.shape[1] sampling_freq = 1200 # sampling frequency epochs_np = np.empty((n_samples, 2) ) # Get data - averaging across EEG channels epochs_np[:,0] = attend6.data.mean(axis=0) epochs_np[:,1] = attend75.data.mean(axis=0) Next, we can use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to transform the data from the time domain to the frequency domain. For this, we’ll need to import the FFT packages from scipy:\nfrom scipy.fft import fft, fftfreq, fftshift # Get FFT fftdat = np.abs(fft(epochs_np, axis=0)) / n_samples freq = fftfreq(n_samples, d=1 / sampling_freq) # get frequency bins Now that we have our frequency transformed data, we can plot our two conditions to assess whether attention altered the SSVEP amplitudes:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt fig,ax = plt.subplots(1, 1) ax.plot(freq, fftdat[:,0], '-', label='attend 6Hz', color=[78 / 255, 185 / 255, 159 / 255]) ax.plot(freq, fftdat[:,1], '-', label='attend 7.5Hz', color=[236 / 255, 85 / 255, 58 / 255]) ax.set_xlim(4, 17) ax.set_ylim(0, 1e-6) ax.set_title('Frequency Spectrum') ax.legend() This plot shows that the SSVEPs were indeed modulated by attention in the direction we would expect! Congratulations! You’ve run your first analysis of EEG data in neurodesktop.\n","categories":"","description":"Use mne-python to load, pre-process, and plot example EEG data in a jupyter notebook through vscode. \n","excerpt":"Use mne-python to load, pre-process, and plot example EEG data in a …","ref":"/tutorials/electrophysiology/eeg_mne-python/","tags":"","title":"Analysing EEG Data with MNE"},{"body":"Neurodesk provides a containerised data analysis environment to facilitate reproducible analysis of neuroimaging data. At Neurodesk, we believe that reproducibility should be a fundamental principle underlying neuroscientific data analysis (1). Analysis pipelines for neuroimaging data typically rely on specific versions of packages and software, and are dependent on their native operating system. These dependencies mean that a working analysis pipeline may fail or produce different results on a new computer, or even on the same computer after a software update. Neurodesk provides a platform in which anyone, anywhere, using any computer can reproduce your original research findings given the original data and analysis code.\nWhat is a container? The Neurodesk environment allows users to build and use containers for analysing neuroimaging data. Containers can be compared to virtual machines, in that they allow users to create a virtual, isolated computing environment with an operating system separate to that of the host machine. However, containers differ from virtual machines in that they virtualise software rather than hardware. Practically, this means that container images require few system resources to install, start-up quickly, and are easily portable between computers. To read more about Docker containers, visit the Docker webpage\nThe Neurodesk ecosystem The Neurodesk ecosystem includes a number of tools for containerised analysis of neuroimaging data. These include:\nNeurodesktop  If you’re new to Neurodesk, we recommend you begin with Neurodesktop.\n Neurodesktop is a compact Docker container with a browser-accessible virtual desktop that allows you develop and implement data analysis pipelines as though you’re on your own computer. The neurodesktop container has the basic tools required for the analysis of fMRI and EEG data pre-installed. To get started, see: Neurodesktop\nNeurocommand Neurocommand offers the option to install and manage multiple distinct containers for more advanced users who prefer a command-line interface. Neurocommand is the recommended interface for users seeking to use Neurodesk in high performance computing (HPC) environments.\nTo get started, see: Neurocommand\nTransparent-singularity The applications pre-installed in neurodesktop and neurocommand are accessible through transparent-singularity, which allows users to transparently use containerised software as through it were installed natively.\nTo find out more about this open-source project, see: transparent-singularity\nNeurocontainers The neurocontainers repository contains build scripts for sub-containers which are wrapped around executables for neuroimaging data-analysis software. These neurocontainers can be used in combination with neurocommand or transparent-singularity.\nTo get started, see: Neurocontainers\nNeurodocker Neurodocker is a command-line program that generates custom Dockerfiles and Singularity recipes for neuroimaging and minifies existing containers.\nTo find out more about this open-source project, see: Neurodocker\nReferences    National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019.

Regardless of what operating system you installed neurodesktop into, the release date would have been at the end of the docker run command:\nWe regularly update neurodesktop to make sure it’s running well and has up-to-date software. You can check the Release History page for details of previous releases. If you’d like to update your container at any time, simply switch out the release number for the version you would like. If you’ve finished working on an analysis pipeline and would like to share it with others, you can point them toward the stable release number that you worked in. That way anyone, on any computer around the world can replicate your analysis pipeline in the exact same computing environment that you developed it in.\nVideo tutorial Click here to watch a 2 minute tutorial video from OHBM 2021\nHow to access files from your Host computer There are various ways of connecting your data to to Neurodesktop. For more information see our Storage section: Storage\nHow to launch applications Click on the Launcher icon in bottom-left corner and navigate to the “Neurodesk” menu, then select the application and version you wish to launch. If it is the first time you launch the application, it will be downloaded to your desktop environment. The application is ready to use when the “Singularity\u003e” prompt appears in the terminal window that opens. If you chose in the menu the GUI of the application (e.g., fsleyesGUI 6.0.3), it will open automatically. If you chose that application itself (e.g., fsl 6.0.3), a terminal window will open, and you can use it to run any of the utilities packaged with the application, including the graphical utilities (e.g., typing “fsl” to run FSL’s main menu).\nHow to keep your modifications in the container We designed neurodesk with reproducibility as a main goal, so the desktop containers should not be modified if one aims for full reproducibility. However, there is one good option to keep your settings across different container versions: You can write a shell script that installs additional packages and modifies the environment so it’s perfect for you. This script can then be re-executed in a new desktop version and will enable a reprudcible customization.\nAnother option is to “save” your docker container including all changes you made. This could be useful when your changes are too difficult to write a shell script or when you do not care about reproducibilty as much and you just want to get the job done. To do this you can commit (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/) your container and by uploading the container to your own docker hub you could even share it.\nHow to force a complete container download to your system To increase speed and reliability of Neurodesktop we mount the application containers from a CVMFS mount and download only the files required to run your current task. Although we aim to keep everything on there reproducible, there might be a reason that you want to fully download the containers to your system. You can force this behaviour by adding another parameter to the docker call: -e CVMFS_DISABLE=true\nFor windows an example would look like this:\ndocker run --shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --name neurodesktop -v C:/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage -e CVMFS_DISABLE=true -p 8080:8080 -h neurodesktop-20211207 vnmd/neurodesktop:20211207 ","categories":"","description":"Congratulations!

Here is an example how to setup rclone with CloudStor Aarnet:\n start the configuration in a terminal window rclone config Create a new remote: n Provide a name for the remote: CloudStor For the “Storage” option choose: webdav As “url” set: https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/remote.php/webdav/ As “vendor” set OwnCloud: 2 Set your CloudStor username after generating an access token https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/settings/personal?sectionid=security Choose to type in your own password: y Enter the Password / Token from the CloudStor App passwords page and confirm it again: Leave blank the bearer_token: \u003chit Enter\u003e No advanced config necessary: \u003chit Enter\u003e accept the configuration: \u003chit Enter\u003e Quit the config: q Now we can download data to the HPC easily: rclone copy --progress --transfers 8 CloudStor:/raw-data-for-science-paper . or upload data to CloudStor: rclone copy --progress --transfers 8 . CloudStor:/data-processed  Globus We also provide the globus client, so you can transfer large amounts of data between globus endpoints and Neurodesktop. You can configure it by running:\n/opt/globusconnectpersonal/globusconnectpersonal-*/globusconnectpersonal Once authenticated you can go to the globus file-manager https://app.globus.org/file-manager and your neurodesktop instance will be an endpoint for globus.\nMounting network storage on your host-computer The -v C:/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage part of the docker command links the directory “neurodesktop-storage” on the “C drive” of your Windows computer to the directory /neurodesktop-storage inside the Desktop environment. Everything you store in there will be available inside the desktop and on the host computer. You can also mount additional directories by adding another -v parameter set (e.g. -v D:/moredata:/data) - this will mount the directory moredata from your D drive to /data inside neurodesktop. Improtant: the mountpoint inside neurodesktop should be named /data (or anything from this list: https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers/blob/master/recipes/globalMountPointList.txt) - otherwise most of the tools will not be able to access the data.\nMount volume using SSHFS It is theoretically possible to mount an SSH target inside Neurodesktop, but it’s not a very reliable way of mounting storage:\nsshfs -o allow_root USER@TARGET_HOST:TARGET_PATH SOURCE_PATH A better option is to use scp and copy data from an SSH endpoint:\nscp /neurodesk/myfile user@remoteserver:/data/ ","categories":"","description":"Add storage to Neurodesktop\n","excerpt":"Add storage to Neurodesktop\n","ref":"/docs/neurodesktop/storage/","tags":"","title":"Storage"},{"body":"Following guide is for connecting to a Neurodesktop using a VS Code installation running on your host machine.\n Additional instructions if your Neurodesktop is running remotely (i.e. Cloud, HPC, VM)\n Pre-requisites Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com) installed on your host.
